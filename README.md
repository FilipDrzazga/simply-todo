# TodoApp with Firebase:calendar:


## Project overview::clipboard:

TodoApp is a training project I developed as I work toward becoming a front-end developer. I'm leveraging cutting-edge technologies to enhance your productivity, including Framer Motion for animations and Firebase for real-time collaboration. Redux Toolkit is responsible for seamless state management, and the app is fully responsive with media queries for phone, tablet, and desktop users.


## Key Features::key:

**Authentication & Authorization:** Powered by Firebase, my app ensures secure user authentication and role-based authorization.

**Real-Time Collaboration:** Share your todo board with others and experience real-time updates on shared tasks and boards.

**Invitations:** Receive and accept invitations from other users in real time for seamless collaboration.

**Basic Functionalities:** Easily add, edit, and delete tasks. Create new boards and manage your tasks effortlessly.
